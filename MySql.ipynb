They organize data into tables with predefined schemas, where each row represents a record, and each column represents a specific attribute or field. SQL databases enforce relationships between tables through keys, such as primary keys and foreign keys. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",

Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and Neo4j."
